This is just a personal note for me. 

- Reduce that technical debt of linters. Some really need to go. 
- I'm reducing code cov on both to 70% for now. Next optimizations and changes will definately make it hit high numbers.
- make docs for what mutations we have
- integration tests DO NOT work yet. 
- need serious optimization and revamping of the engine. It's hard coded as of now.
